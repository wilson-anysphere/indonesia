# Primary goals:
# - Bound hangs (stdio LSP tests, process spawn tests, etc.) with per-test timeouts.
# - Keep retries off until specific flakes are identified.

[profile.default]
# Mark tests as slow after 60s, and hard-terminate them after 2 periods (120s).
# This prevents the test suite from hanging indefinitely while still allowing
# some slack for slower CI machines.
slow-timeout = { period = "60s", terminate-after = 2 }

# Start with no retries. Enable per-test retries once specific flakes are
# identified.
retries = 0

[profile.ci]
# In CI, run the full suite even if some tests fail so we get complete results.
fail-fast = false

[profile.ci.junit]
# JUnit report is written to `target/nextest/ci/junit.xml`.
