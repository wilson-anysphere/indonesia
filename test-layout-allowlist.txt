# Integration test layout allowlist
#
# Each `tests/*.rs` file becomes its own integration test binary. `nova-devtools` warns at 2 root
# test files and errors at >2 by default.
#
# This allowlist is a temporary escape hatch for crates that still exceed the limit (so repo
# invariants can pass while we consolidate test harnesses incrementally).
#
# This allowlist is a temporary escape hatch for crates that haven't been consolidated yet.
# We prefer WARNINGS (not failures) for stale entries so the list can be cleaned up gradually.
#
# One crate name per line. `#` comments and blank lines are ignored.
