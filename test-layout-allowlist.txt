# Integration test layout allowlist
#
# Each `tests/*.rs` file becomes its own integration test binary. Our repo guidance is to keep
# only ONE root-level `tests/*.rs` per crate (a single harness), and put additional tests into
# submodules under a directory.
#
# This allowlist is a temporary escape hatch for crates that haven't been consolidated yet.
# We prefer WARNINGS (not failures) for stale entries so the list can be cleaned up gradually.
#
# One crate name per line. `#` comments and blank lines are ignored.
