# Integration test layout allowlist
#
# Each `tests/*.rs` file becomes its own integration test binary. `nova-devtools` warns at 2 root
# test files and errors at >2 by default.
#
# This allowlist is a temporary escape hatch for crates that still exceed the limit (so repo
# invariants can pass while we consolidate test harnesses incrementally).
#
# If a crate becomes compliant (<=2 root `tests/*.rs` files), remove it from this list to avoid
# `stale-test-layout-allowlist-entry` warnings.
#
# One crate name per line. `#` comments and blank lines are ignored.
