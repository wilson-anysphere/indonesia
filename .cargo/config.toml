# Some environments configure a global rustc wrapper (commonly `sccache`) via user Cargo config.
# In sandboxed/CI-like execution this can be flaky (e.g. a broken sccache server causes every
# `cargo` invocation to fail). Disable wrappers by default for this repo; developers that want
# a wrapper can opt back in by setting `RUSTC_WRAPPER` / `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` in their env.
