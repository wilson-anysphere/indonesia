# Fuzz builds are compiled with sanitizers (ASAN) and `-Ccodegen-units=1`, which
# can be very memory hungry. On large-CPU hosts, Cargo's default parallelism can
# spawn so many `rustc` processes that we OOM even with a modest per-process
# address space limit.
#
# Keep the fuzz harnesses buildable in constrained CI / multi-agent sandboxes by
# capping parallelism for the `fuzz/` workspace only.
