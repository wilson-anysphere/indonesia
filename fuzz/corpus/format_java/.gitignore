# Keep the checked-in seed corpus small.
#
# libFuzzer will write new corpus entries directly into the corpus directory.
# These are typically extensionless (e.g. sha1-like names or `id:...`), while
# our checked-in seeds are `*.java`.
#
# Note: this corpus intentionally reuses a curated subset of
# `fuzz/corpus/fuzz_format/` so the optional `format_java` target starts with
# high-signal seeds.
