# Keep the checked-in seed corpus small.

# libFuzzer will write new corpus entries directly into the corpus directory.
# These are typically extensionless (e.g. sha1-like names or `id:...`), while
# our checked-in seeds are `*.java`.
#
# Note: this corpus intentionally reuses a curated subset of Java inputs so the
# optional `refactor_smoke` target starts with realistic programs.
